# Examples

In these examples, the anomalous Lagrangian of Chiral Perturbation Theory at order p^8 is obtained. 

This is done with the small-u parametrization of the fields, in which all matrices share the chiral transformation.

 - `ChPT_Anomalous_SmallU.m`

The contact operators with only external fields are not measurable. These are obtained with a different parametrization that shows them explicitly.

 - `ChPT_Anomalous_LR_ContactTerms.m`
 
The resulting bases are combined at the end of `ChPT_Anomalous_SmallU.m`, and the result given in the folder `FINAL_BASES`.
