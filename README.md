Tools to calculate minimal Lagrangians explicitly with Mathematica

version 0.0: October 2nd, 2023

Author: Joan Ruiz-Vidal

## Description

This software provides a set of tools to aid the calculation of operator bases in QFT Lagrangians.
These tools have been developed for the case of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) with pseudoscalar mesons and external fields, and, in particular, to obtain the anomalous Lagrangian of ChPT at order p6/p8. The two given examples of minimal bases lead to the final result, written in two different parameterizations of the field content.


## Acknowledgements

The underlying algorithms and structure of the calculation has been shaped in collaboration with 
 - Johan Bijnens (Lund University)
 - Nils Hermansson-Truedsson (Lund University; Edinburgh University) 

Both of them posses extensive expertise in these type of analyses [[1810.06834](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06834), [hep-ph/0110400](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0110400), [hep-ph/9902437](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9902437)] and conducted independent calculations of this Lagrangian with a different software.

Crucial inputs for constructing and optimizing part of the code presented here were generously provided by the community of mathematica.stackexchange.com.
